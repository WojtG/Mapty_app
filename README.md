<h2>Description</h2>

An app that allows users to plan workouts and display them on a map. Users can select the type of workout and add workout data, and then the workout will be displayed on the map. The map and markers have been rendered using the Leaflet library. The workout data is stored in the browser using the LocalStorage API, so users can save their workouts. To identify the workout objects, crypto.randomUUID() was used to set a unique identifier for each object.
